0. Besides 4 × 4 (which are Game of Fifteen’s dimensions), what other dimensions does the framework allow?
Any squared int structure between 3 & 9, inclusive.

1. With what sort of data structure is the game’s board represented?
Initially, a fixed length d-length array of a d-length array of ints. But I am a baller so I'm going to do this as a pointer to an int with memory allocated with malloc().

`greet();`

3. What functions do you apparently need to implement?
draw, init, move, won
